# Building

The project consists of one shared Java 8 core, nine modern Fabric modules, one 1.16.5 Fabric
module, and two independent legacy Forge builds. Legacy ForgeGradle cannot run directly on modern
JDKs, so one root Gradle command cannot build every version.

## Fabric 26.3

JDK 25 or later is required:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-26.3:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-26.3/build/libs/`. This version is Fabric-only; there is no
matching Forge/NeoForge project.

## Fabric 26.2

JDK 25 or later is required:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-26.2:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-26.2/build/libs/`.

## Fabric 26.1

JDK 25 or later is required:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-26.1:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-26.1/build/libs/`.

## Fabric 1.21.11

JDK 21 or later is required:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-1.21.11:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-1.21.11/build/libs/`.

## Fabric 1.21.10

JDK 21 or later is required:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-1.21.10:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-1.21.10/build/libs/`.

## Fabric 1.16.5

Java 8 is the compilation target; the local launch check also ran on Java 8:

```bash
./gradlew :platform-fabric-1.16.5:build
```

Output is written to `platform-fabric-1.16.5/build/libs/`. This version uses legacy Loom with a
single `src/main` source set (1.16.5 has no separate server JAR, so `splitEnvironmentSourceSets()`
cannot be used) and is Fabric-only. Note that the Fabric API mod id in the 1.16.5 era is `fabric`,
not `fabric-api`, so `fabric.mod.json` must declare that dependency accordingly.

## Forge 1.12.2

A full JDK 8 installation is required. Enter `legacy/forge-1.12.2/` and run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The wrapper is pinned to Gradle 4.10.3, ForgeGradle to 3.0.197, and Forge to 14.23.5.2860.

## Forge 1.8.9

A full JDK 8 installation is required. Enter `legacy/forge-1.8.9/` and run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The wrapper is pinned to Gradle 2.14.1, ForgeGradle uses the 2.1 series, and Forge is pinned to
11.15.1.2318-1.8.9.

If Gradle itself is running under a legacy JRE that has `java` but no `javac`, specify another
compatible compiler explicitly with
`./gradlew build -PlegacyJavac=/absolute/path/to/javac`. A normal full JDK 8 installation does not
need this argument.

## Core self-test

The root `translator-core` project does not depend on Minecraft. Its test sources are under
`translator-core/src/test/java/`. Compile them with Java 8 compatibility and run
`org.universaltranslator.core.CoreSelfTest`. The tests cover formatting protection, dynamic
templates, caching, concurrent request coalescing, failure fallback, endpoint security,
non-blocking rendering, and hashed persistence.

Do not commit local `config/universal-translator.properties` files, API keys, game logs, Gradle
caches, or Minecraft assets.
